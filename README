Usage:

Provide YouTube video link or ID, optionally specify a max 15-second time period, and submit for colorization.

Script assumes video is black and white. Submitting a color video will just be wasteful.

Audio is lost and not in-scope, yet.

Processed videos are auto-uploaded to YouTube? Or on own server? Links provided in the web interface and via email after processing completes.

Limitations:
