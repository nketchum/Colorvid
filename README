Usage:

Provide YouTube video link or ID and submit for colorization. Script assumes video is black and white. Submitting a color video will just be wasteful. Audio is lost and not in-scope, yet.

Processed videos are auto-uploaded to YouTube? Or on own server? Links provided in the web interface and via email after processing completes.

Dependencies:
- colorization (torch+lua)
- ffmpeg
- imagemagick

Limitations:

- YouTube input
- 480x480 max resolution
- mp4 out mimetype

Improvements:

- Status output
- Parallel processing
- Audio function
- Color accuracy
